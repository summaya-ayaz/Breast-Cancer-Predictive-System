# Breast-Cancer-Predictive-System
The notebook builds a neural network to classify breast cancer as benign (0) or malignant (1). It preprocesses data, encodes labels, scales features, and trains a Sequential model with ReLU and Sigmoid activation. The model is evaluated using accuracy/loss plots and tested on new data for predictions.
