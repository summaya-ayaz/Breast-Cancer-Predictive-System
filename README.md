# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

## Overview

This project builds a neural network to classify breast cancer as benign (0) or malignant (1) using a dataset containing tumor characteristics.

## Features

Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)

## Feature correlation analysis

Train-test split (70-30%)

Neural network implementation using TensorFlow/Keras

Model training, evaluation, and visualization

Prediction on new input data

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (data preprocessing)

TensorFlow/Keras (neural network)

## Installation

Install dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow

Run the Jupyter Notebook or script.

## Usage

Load the dataset and preprocess it.

Train the neural network on the training set.

Evaluate the model using accuracy and loss plots.

Use the trained model for predictions on new data.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying breast cancer, visualized using performance metrics like accuracy and loss curves.
