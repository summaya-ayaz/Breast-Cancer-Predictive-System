# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

## Overview

This project develops a deep learning model to classify breast cancer as benign (0) or malignant (1) based on tumor characteristics using a dataset from medical research. The model utilizes a neural network implemented in TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical data.

### Feature Engineering: 
Correlation analysis and feature selection.

### Dataset Splitting: 
Training (70%) and Testing (30%) split.

### Model Architecture: 
Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with:
  - Input layer with 30 features
  - Hidden layers with ReLU activation
  - Output layer with sigmoid activation

### Model Compilation and Training: 
Using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.

### Evaluation 
Metrics: Accuracy, loss analysis, and visualizations.

### Prediction Capability: 
Classification of new input data.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

## Libraries & Frameworks:

  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (Data Preprocessing & Model Evaluation)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (Neural Network Implementation)
